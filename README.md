  <h3>Progress Update</h3>
  <p> Overall the project is coming along nicely. The primary GameLoop file is capable of dealing with many different
  commands. Once the User Interface is completed, however, the gameloop will need to be modified to allow it to handle
  all of the commands that the game requires. At this stage, the AI is the main focus. Once the AI is completed, the 
  game should fundamentally be ready for play. While this play will be simple, it represents the stage at which this
  could officially be called a "game".
  
  There are many improvements to come. Artwork will slowly be produced in order to fulfill the needs of the game. As of
  now only 4 of the units are completely accessible within the game, however this will be fixed as the files are
  completed.
